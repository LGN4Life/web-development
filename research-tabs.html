          <p class="intro-text"> My research has largely focused on the fundamental question of how visual signals from the retina are transmitted through
            the lateral gniculate nucleus (LGN) to primary visual cortex (V1). The output neurons of the retina are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The axons of RGCs form the optic nerve and
            optic tract, which provides monosynaptic excitation to the LGN. Individual LGN neurons receive input from one to several RGCs, depending on the species and retinotopic excentricity
            (i.e, distance from the fovea). ~85% of LGN neurons send excitatory input to V1 and are classified as relay neurons. The largest component of the LGN to V1 projection
            goes to layer 4, with smaller projections to layer 6 and layer 2/3. This feed forward componet is just the back bone
            upon which visual processing flows from the retina to V1.</p>

            <p class="retinogeniculate-text"> We have studied the activation of LGN neurons by retinal excitation quite directly and extensively by recording monosynapticly RGC-LGN pairs. This means
              we simultaneously record an RGC and and an LGN neuron that receives synaptic input from the recorded RGC. Using statistical analysis we can measure how changes in the
              visual scene or changes in the overall network state influence how and when retinal activity is transmitted to V1.</p>
