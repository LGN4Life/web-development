  <h1>Research</h1>
  <div class="overview">
    <div class="intro">
      <p>My research has largely focused on the fundamental question of how visual signals from the retina are transmitted through
        the lateral gniculate nucleus (LGN) to primary visual cortex (V1). </p>
      <p>The output neurons of the retina are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The axons of RGCs form the optic nerve and
        optic tract, which provides monosynaptic excitation to the LGN. Individual LGN neurons receive input from one to several RGCs, depending on the species and retinotopic excentricity
        (i.e, distance from the fovea). ~85% of LGN neurons send excitatory input to V1 and are classified as relay neurons. The largest component of the LGN to V1 projection
        goes to layer 4, with smaller projections to layer 6 and layer 2/3.</p>

      <h2>Retinogeniculate communication</h2>
      <p>We have studied the activation of LGN neurons by retinal excitation quite directly and extensively by recording monosynapticly RGC-LGN pairs. This means
        we simultaneously record an RGC and and an LGN neuron that receives synaptic input from the recorded RGC. Using statistical analysis we can measure how changes in the
        visual scene or changes in the overall network state influence how and when retinal activity is transmitted to V1.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RostaAYQC5TnXnXFrW6Tf33w2wqsp2Y1">Contrast gain control is present in both the retina and the LGN</a>. However, contrast gain control is augmented in the LGN. The consquence of this augmentation
          is that retinal spikes are more effective in driving LGN activity when the visual stimulus is low contrast.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xQgGHQ15UWidSdDSj9VW64SCnn23gadE">Extraclassical suppression is about 50% stronger in the LGN than it is in the retina.</a>
          This form of suppression takes only ~7-10ms to appear! Thus, it opperates as an
          untrafast mechanism to gate retinal activity from reaching V1.</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zg8kgkAVx7CRtCwYrDb_hJusfQqq10MB">Retinogeniculate communication is modualted by thalamic bursts.</a>
          When the correct conditions are meet, the mechanisms that trigger thalamic bursts, such as T-type Ca++ channels cause retinal spikes to become more
          effective in driving LGN activity during. </li>
